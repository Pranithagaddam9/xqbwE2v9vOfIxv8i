# **Customer Survey Happiness Analysis**  

## **Overview**  
This project, completed at Apziva, focuses on analyzing customer survey data to understand factors influencing customer happiness. Using machine learning and data analysis techniques, we identify key drivers of customer satisfaction and provide actionable insights.  

## **Project Structure**  
- **`CustomerSurveyHappiness.ipynb`** – The main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis, data preprocessing, modeling, and insights.  
- **`data/`** – Folder containing raw and processed survey data.  
- **`models/`** – Trained models used for predicting customer happiness scores.  
- **`visualizations/`** – Plots and graphs showcasing key findings.  

## **Methods and Approach**  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and performed feature scaling.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized survey responses to identify patterns and correlations.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Selected key attributes influencing customer happiness.  
- **Modeling**: Implemented machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression) to predict customer satisfaction levels.  
- **Evaluation**: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to compare model performance.  
- **Insights & Recommendations**: Identified the most critical factors affecting customer happiness and provided strategic recommendations.  

## **Key Accomplishments**  
✅ Improved predictive accuracy using advanced ML techniques.  
✅ Identified top factors contributing to customer happiness.  
✅ Provided data-driven recommendations for business decision-making.  

## **Conclusion**  
This project successfully demonstrates the power of machine learning in deriving insights from survey data. By identifying key drivers of customer happiness, businesses can enhance customer experience and satisfaction.
